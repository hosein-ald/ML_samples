# 🧠 ML_sample

This repository is a personal archive of simple machine learning projects, created as part of my training and ongoing practice. It includes implementations of various ML models, each organized in its own folder along with the dataset and code. My goal is to build and document all major types of models — from basic regressions to deep learning — using Python and common libraries.

Each subfolder in this repo represents a specific model or technique (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, SVM, neural networks), and typically contains:

- 📊 A sample dataset (e.g., CSV file)
- 🧮 The implementation in Jupyter Notebook and/or Python script
- 📝 Optional notes or experiment logs

The code is developed using Python (mainly with Anaconda and `uv` environments), and uses tools like Jupyter Notebook or VSCode, depending on the project.

### ✅ What’s Included

This archive will include examples of:

- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees, Random Forests  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Naive Bayes  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- XGBoost  
- Clustering (e.g., KMeans, DBSCAN)  
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)  
- Neural Networks (e.g., MLPClassifier)

### 🛠 Dependencies

All projects use a common stack of Python libraries:

- `numpy`  
- `pandas`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `scikit-learn`  

You can install dependencies via `uv`:

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or via Conda:

```bash
conda create -n ml_sample python=3.11
conda activate ml_sample
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### 📚 Purpose

This is a personal learning repo for exploring machine learning models hands-on. It’s not meant to be production-ready or exhaustive, but rather a curated collection of practice projects for future reference and experimentation.

### 🤝 Contributions

While this is primarily a personal project, I’m open to suggestions or pull requests that help improve code readability or correctness.
